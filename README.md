# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the election audit is to proived the additional analysis asked by the election commission, which was to determine the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. To do so I'll use my knowledge of `for` loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, I'll print the results to the command line and save them to .txt file.

## Election-Audit Results
To show the results of the Election-Audit, I will answer the following questions using screenshots from the [election_analysis.txt file](https://github.com/kellyd7/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Election_Analysis/analysis/election_analysis.txt):

1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

## Election-Audit Summary

In summary, this script proved to be effective in finding the additional data requested. We could also used this script in other elections, with a few modifications, to determine the number of votes each candidate recieved per county. This will help the election commission understand candidate popularity amongst the counties participating in the election. We could also use this script to determine candidate popularity amongst voter demographics, such as race, throught the election. This will only be possible given the `.CSV` file has demographic information. There are a number ways this script can be adjusted to determine just about anything the elections commission would like to know. It's just a matter of what information is provided in the `.CSV` file.
